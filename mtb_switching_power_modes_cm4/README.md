# PSoC 6 MCU Switching between Power Modes

This example demonstrates how to transition PSoCÂ® 6 MCU to the following power modes - Low Power Active, Low Power Sleep, Ultra Low Power Active, Ultra Low Power Sleep, and Deep Sleep.

## Overview

This code example shows how to enter system Low Power (LP) and Ultra Low Power (ULP) modes, and transition to CPU Sleep or Deep Sleep mode. The system modes affect the whole device, and the CPU modes affect only one CPU. After transitioning to Deep Sleep or Sleep mode, the example also shows how to wake up and return to LP or ULP mode. This example does not cover Hibernate Mode. For more information on this mode, see the PSoC 6 documentation. [AN219528 - PSoC 6 MCU Low-Power Modes and Power Reduction Techniques](http://www.cypress.com/an219528) provides additional details on the PSoC 6 MCU power modes, use of the SysPM driver, and other recommendations for reducing power consumption.

The project uses a kit button to change power mode. [Figure 1](#figure-1-power-mode-state-machine) shows the state machine implemented in the firmware to execute the transitions.

The project also uses one LED to indicate the power mode selected. [Table 1](#table-1-LED-State-in-various-power-modes) shows the state of the LED for each mode.

Table 1. LED State in various Power Modes

| **System/Power Mode** | **LED State** |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| System LP/CPU Active | Blinks quickly |
| System LP/CPU Sleep | Turned ON and bright |
| System ULP/CPU Active | Blinks slowly |
| System ULP/CPU Sleep | Turned ON and dimmed |
| System/Deep Sleep | Turned OFF |


## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox IDE](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolbox) v2.0  
- Programming Language: C  
- Associated Parts: All PSoC 6 MCU [parts](https://www.cypress.com/PSoC6)

## Supported Kits

- [PSoC 6 Wi-Fi BT Prototyping Kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CPROTO-062-4343W)

## Hardware Setup

The example does not require any additional hardware to run. However, you can connect an ammeter to measure the current consumed by the PSoC MCU device. If using any of the PSoC 6 MCU Pioneer kits, remove the jumper PWR_MON from the kit and connect the ammeter on the header pins. This jumper is at the bottom side of the PSoC 6 MCU Pioneer kits. See the kit guide for the exact location. If using any of the Proto Board kits, see the kit guide how to measure the current. It might require changes in the hardware.

## Software Setup

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the Code Example

#### In the ModusToolbox IDE

1. Click the **New Application** link in the Quick Panel (or, use **File > New > ModusToolbox IDE Application**).

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **IDE Application** dialog. When you select a supported kit the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit.

3. In the **Starter Application** window, choose the example.

4. Click **Next** and complete the application creation process.

 If you are unfamiliar with this process, see [KBA225201](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-15968) for all the details.

#### In Command-line Interface (CLI)

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.
2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.
3. Import required libraries by executing the command `make getlibs`.

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the USB connector.

2. Program the board.

   #### Using ModusToolbox IDE

   1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.
   2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3)**.

   #### Using CLI

   1. From the terminal, execute the command `make program` to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
        ```
        make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
        ```
        Example:

        ```
        make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-062-WiFi-BT TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
        ```
        **Note**:  Before building the application, ensure the *libs* folder contains the BSP (*.lib*) file corresponding to the TARGET. Execute `make getlibs` to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.

3. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that kit LED blinks at 5 Hz (approximately). Take note of the current consumption. The device is in System LP and CPU Active modes at this moment.

4. Press the kit button for approximately one second and release it. Observe that the LED is ON and fully bright. Confirm that the current consumption drops a few hundreds of microamperes. The device is in System LP and CPU Sleep modes at this moment.

5. Quickly press the kit button to return to System LP and CPU Active modes. Observe that the LED blinks quickly again.

6. Press the kit button for at least two seconds and release it. Observe that the LED is OFF and that the current consumption has dropped to a few microamperes. The device is in System Deep Sleep mode at this moment.

7. Quickly press the kit button to return to System LP mode. Observe that the LED blinks quickly and that the current consumption has increased to the same level measured before.

8. Quickly press the kit button again to enter System ULP mode. Observe that the LED blinks slowly and that the current consumption has dropped significantly when compared to System LP mode. You can quickly press the kit button to switch between the two modes.

9. Keep the device in System ULP mode and press the kit button for approximately one second and release it. Observe that the LED dims and that the current consumption has dropped a few hundred microamperes. The device is in the System ULP and CPU Sleep modes at this moment.

10. Quickly press the kit button to return to the System ULP and CPU Active modes. Observe that the is blinking slowly again.

11. Press the kit button for at least two seconds and release it. Observe that the LED is OFF and that the current consumption has dropped to a few microamperes. The device is in System Deep Sleep mode at this moment.

12. Quickly press the user button and return to the System ULP and CPU Active modes. Observe that the LED blinks slowly again and that the current consumption has increased to the same level measured before.

### Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the ModusToolbox IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. If you are unfamiliar with how to start a debug session with ModusToolbox IDE, see [KBA224621](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-15763).

## Design and Implementation

This example configures the TCPWM resource in PWM mode to blink, dim and turn ON/OFF the LED. The firmware implements the state machine shown in the Overview section and controls the duty cycle of the PWM block. The device wakes up when a switch press is detected. [Figure 2](#figure-2-cm4-cpu-flowchart) shows the firmware flow of CM4 CPU.

Six power callback functions are registered. [Table 2](#table-2-state-modes-(cy_SYSPM_*)) shows the actions of each callback function. For more information on power callbacks, see the PDL Driver - System Power Management (SysPm).

| | CHECK_READY | CHECK_FAIL | BEFORE_TRANSITION | AFTER_TRANSITION |
|---| ---| --- | --- | --- |
| PWM Sleep Callback | Nothing | Nothing | If in System ULP Mode, dim the LED. If in System LP Mode, turn ON the LED. | If in System ULP Mode, blink the LED slowly. If in System LP, blink the LED fast. |
